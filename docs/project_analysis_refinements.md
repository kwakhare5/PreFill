# PreFill — Deep Research Analysis & Refinements

This document provides a technical critique, scale-out analysis, and product refinement list for the PreFill codebase. These recommendations are designed to transition the current localhost prototype into a production-grade platform capable of serving millions of households.

## 1. Machine Learning & Forecasting Refinements

### 1.1 CPU Scale-Out Bottlenecks of Prophet
*   **The Problem:** Currently, the system runs a weekly `rebuild_all_models` job that fits a separate Facebook Prophet time-series model per item, per household. For 1 million households ordering 30 recurring items, fitting 30 million Prophet models will saturate CPU infrastructure (Prophet requires ~1–3 seconds per fit).
*   **Refinement (Tiered Modeling):**
    *   **Staples Tier:** Items with high regularity (e.g., Amul Taza Milk ordered every 1–2 days) do not need complex Prophet fits. Use a simple, fast **Holt-Winters double exponential smoothing** or rolling average model.
    *   **Volatile/Seasonal Tier:** Reserve CPU-heavy Prophet fits exclusively for items with clear weekly/seasonal patterns (e.g., cooking oil, festive sweets, seasonal vegetables).
*   **Impact:** Reduces background compute footprints by up to 80% while retaining high predictive accuracy.

### 1.2 Cold-Start Heuristics
*   **The Problem:** The system requires at least 3 orders to fit a model, and returns low-confidence predictions until ~10 data points are logged. This leaves new users with a blank overview page.
*   **Refinement (Profile-Based Default Baselines):**
    *   Leverage the **Household Inferred Profile** immediately. If the user joins and declares (or the system estimates from 1 order) a "small family of 4", bootstrap their timeline with average Small Family baseline consumption rates (e.g., 1L milk/2 days, 5kg Atta/18 days).
    *   Over time, perform a bayesian update to shift baseline parameters toward their actual observed order intervals.

## 2. Agent & NLP Dialogue Refinements

### 2.1 Vector Search Substitution via pgvector
*   **The Problem:** The Recipe Agent currently uses token-set intersection and substring matching to link recipe ingredient strings (e.g., *"basmati rice"*) to catalog listings (e.g., *"India Gate Basmati Rice 5kg"*). This fails on semantic synonyms (e.g., *"cilantro"* vs *"coriander"* or *"makhan"* vs *"butter"*).
*   **Refinement (pgvector Semantic Search):**
    *   Generate vector embeddings for all Instamart catalog items on startup and store them in the PostgreSQL database (which already has `pgvector` enabled).
    *   When Claude parses a recipe, embed the ingredient name and run a cosine similarity query directly in the DB:
        ```sql
        SELECT item_name, price FROM catalog_embeddings 
        ORDER BY embedding <=> :ingredient_embedding LIMIT 1;
        ```
*   **Impact:** Resolves ingredient translation gaps and improves recipe-to-cart accuracy from ~70% to >95%.

### 2.2 Dialogue Session Expirations (TTL Checkpoint)
*   **The Problem:** The LangGraph agent relies on a persistent thread ID (`phone_number`) stored in PostgreSQL. If a user receives a restocking prompt but ignores it, and then texts "YES" three days later, the checkpointer will pick up the stale state and place the three-day-old order.
*   **Refinement (Context Window TTL):**
    *   Add a timestamp check inside the LangGraph webhook router. If the elapsed time since the last recorded state transitions exceeds 12 hours, clear the checkpointer thread and treat the message as a fresh query.

## 3. Infrastructure & Scale Refinements

### 3.1 Pub-Sub Price Alert Architecture
*   **The Problem:** The Price Agent loops through commodities daily and updates alerts. In production, looping through and pushing alerts to every household sequentially will cause severe HTTP bottlenecks and Twilio rate-limiting lockups.
*   **Refinement (Publish-Subscribe Model):**
    *   Decouple price tracking from notifications. Write alerts to a central `global_price_alerts` table.
    *   Configure a worker pool that fetches active alerts and fans out push notifications via Swiggy's native mobile app socket layer (reserving Twilio/WhatsApp only for users with high conversion probabilities to manage WhatsApp business billing costs).

### 3.2 Time-Series Hypertable Partitioning
*   **The Problem:** TimescaleDB is enabled for `price_history`, which is excellent. However, we should also partition the `orders` and `restock_alerts` tables. Over years of operations, order logs grow exponentially.
*   **Refinement:** Convert `orders` into a hypertable partitioned by `placed_at` and configure a data retention policy that archives order data older than 2 years into cold S3 storage.

## 4. Product Moat & UX Enhancements

### 4.1 "Predictive Cart" Integration on Swiggy App
*   **Refinement:** Instead of relying entirely on WhatsApp, integrate the depletion forecasts directly inside the Swiggy Instamart homepage as a **"Your Smart Shelf"** tray. It displays items forecasted to run out in the next 48 hours, letting the user swipe-to-add them to their current basket.

### 4.2 Auto-Restock Subscription Logic
*   **Refinement:** Allow users to flag specific staples (like Milk and Bread) for **"Autopilot Restocking"**. The system places the order without prompting them on WhatsApp, but holds the delivery in a 1-hour "grace window" where the user can cancel/amend it from a push notification.
