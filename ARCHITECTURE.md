# ARCHITECTURE.md — The Technical Blueprint

_This document is for HUMANS to read. The AI will only read this when explicitly commanded via `@ZOOM` or when investigating complex database/architecture tasks._

## 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW & BUSINESS LOGIC

### The Simple Version
Instamart Intelligence is an AI system that sits on top of Swiggy Instamart and watches how your household consumes groceries over time. It learns your patterns — how fast you go through milk, oil, atta, eggs — and sends you a WhatsApp message before you run out, asking if you want to reorder. One tap and it's done.

It's the difference between a grocery app and a grocery assistant.

### The Real-World Analogy
Imagine you had a full-time house manager — someone who lives with you, watches what leaves the kitchen shelf, and automatically handles restocking. Before your cooking oil runs out, they've already placed the Instamart order. Before you plan Sunday biryani, they've already checked what's in the pantry and added the missing ingredients to the cart.

That house manager is what this app pretends to be — except it's software that reads your Instamart order history instead of physically watching your shelves.

### Why Does This Matter for Swiggy?
**The existential problem:** Swiggy Instamart and Blinkit are identical products. Same 10-minute delivery. Same Amul milk. Same prices. Same interface. A user has zero reason to be loyal to either one — they open whichever app they remember first.

**The solution this project creates:** If Instamart has been learning your household's grocery patterns for 6 months, it knows things Blinkit cannot know:
- Your family uses 1L milk every 2.1 days.
- You buy 5kg atta every 17 days, not 16 or 18.
- You always buy eggs and bread together on Sunday mornings.
- Your oil consumption spikes in October-November (festive season cooking).
- You were away for 10 days in March (zero orders = travel detected).

If you switch to Blinkit, you lose all of that. You're starting from zero. That intelligence — that knowledge about your household — is the switching cost. That's Swiggy's moat against Blinkit. No other feature creates this kind of lock-in.

### The Five Core Features Explained

#### Consumption Modeling
**What it does in plain English:**
The system reads every Instamart order you've ever placed and builds a profile for each recurring item. It figures out: "This household buys 1L milk every 2.1 days on average. Sometimes 1.9 days, sometimes 2.4 days, but almost always within that range."

**How it works technically:**
- Pulls your complete order history from Swiggy's MCP (API).
- For each item that appears more than 3 times, it runs a time-series analysis using Facebook Prophet (an open-source forecasting library).
- Prophet handles weekly patterns (you buy more groceries on Sunday), seasonal patterns (more milk during festivals), and random noise.
- The output is a consumption model per item: average daily usage, typical purchase cycle, and a confidence score.

**Real example:**
```
Item: Fortune Sunflower Oil (1L)
Orders found: 14 purchases over 4 months
Average daily consumption: 68ml/day
Typical purchase cycle: 14.7 days
Last purchased: May 10 (1L bottle)
Estimated depletion: May 24-25
Confidence: 87%
```

**Why this is hard without AI:**
A human looking at 14 grocery orders would take 20 minutes to notice the pattern. The system does it for all 30-50 recurring items in your household in seconds, and updates the model every time you place a new order.

#### Predictive Restocking
**What it does in plain English:**
Once the system knows your consumption rates, it monitors all your items in the background. Two days before any item is predicted to run out, it sends you a WhatsApp message asking if you want to reorder. You reply YES. It builds the cart and places the order. You never open the app.

**How it works technically:**
- A background scheduler (APScheduler) runs every morning at 8am.
- It checks all consumption models for items where `estimated_depletion_date < NOW() + 2 days`.
- For matching items, it generates a friendly WhatsApp message using Claude API.
- The message is sent via Twilio's WhatsApp API.
- When you reply, a LangGraph agent parses your response and either places the order, modifies the cart, or dismisses the alert.
- The Swiggy Instamart MCP APIs handle the actual cart building and order placement.

**Real example WhatsApp flow:**
```
[8:02 AM from Instamart Intelligence]
🛒 Your household is likely running low on:

• Cooking oil (87% confident — last bought 14 days ago)
• Milk (76% confident — last bought 1.9 days ago)
• Atta (68% confident — last bought 16 days ago)

Reply YES to reorder all, or tell me which ones.

---

[You reply: "just the oil and milk"]

---

[Response within 10 seconds]
Got it! Adding Fortune Sunflower Oil 1L + Amul Milk 1L to cart.
Total: ₹158. Confirming order?

---

[You reply: yes]

---

✅ Order placed! Arriving in ~15 minutes. Order #INS_8821
```

**The anomaly handling:**
The system doesn't blindly predict — it watches for anomalies:
- **Travel detection**: No orders for 5+ days? You're probably traveling. Predictions are paused, not broken.
- **Guest spike**: You bought 3L milk instead of your usual 1L? Guests visited. This outlier is excluded from your baseline model so it doesn't inflate your daily average.
- **Dietary shift**: Your egg purchases dropped 80% over the last month? The system flags a possible dietary change and asks you to confirm before updating your model.

#### Recipe Intelligence
**What it does in plain English:**
You tell the app you're making Sunday biryani for 6. It figures out all the ingredients needed, cross-references against your estimated pantry (based on what you've bought and how fast you use it), and shows you exactly what's missing with a ready-to-order cart.

**How it works technically:**
- You type a recipe name (or paste one) into the app.
- Claude API parses the recipe and extracts all ingredients with quantities (e.g., "400g basmati rice, 300ml yogurt, 2 large onions, 1 tsp saffron...").
- The system checks your "estimated pantry state" — a calculated estimate of what you likely still have based on last purchase date and daily consumption rate.
- Items where your estimated remaining stock is less than what the recipe needs are flagged as "missing".
- Missing items are bundled into a single Instamart cart for one-tap ordering.

**Real example:**
```
Recipe: Dal Makhani for 4 people

Checking pantry...

You likely have:
✓ Black dal (urad) — ~300g estimated remaining
✓ Rajma — bought last week, ~200g left
✓ Butter — 100g pack bought 3 days ago
✓ Garlic, ginger, onions — staples stocked
✓ Cumin, coriander powder — bought in bulk 2 weeks ago

You probably need:
✗ Fresh cream (200ml) — not in recent orders
✗ Kasuri methi — not in recent orders
✗ Heavy cream or malai — not tracked

Missing ingredients cart: ₹120
[Order Missing Items →]
```

**Additional recipe features:**
- Pin recipes to specific dates ("Making biryani this Sunday") — system auto-schedules the missing ingredient check for 2 days before.
- Cuisine week planning: tell the system your weekly meal plan, it gives you a consolidated shopping list.
- Nutritional awareness: if your last 3 restock carts are dominated by processed food or packaged snacks, the system gently flags it.

#### Price Intelligence
**What it does in plain English:**
Certain groceries in India fluctuate wildly — tomatoes, onions, potatoes, cooking oil, atta. The app tracks the price of these volatile staples daily. When tomatoes suddenly cost 140% more than last month, it tells you. When prices dip, it tells you to stock up.

**How it works technically:**
- A daily price scraper calls Swiggy's `search_instamart_items` MCP for each volatile commodity.
- Prices are stored in TimescaleDB (a time-series database) — one row per item per day.
- Each day, the system calculates the current price vs the 30-day rolling average.
- If price > 30% above average: spike alert sent to household.
- If price > 20% below average: dip alert sent, suggesting stock-up.
- Substitution logic: during a tomato spike, the system suggests canned tomatoes or a recipe swap.

**Real example alerts:**
```
📈 Price Alert: Tomatoes
Current: ₹29/100g (+142% vs last month avg of ₹12)
This spike typically lasts 8-12 days based on past patterns.
Suggestion: Use canned tomatoes for this week's cooking,
or wait 7-8 days before restocking fresh.

---

📉 Price Dip: Fortune Sunflower Oil (1L)
Current: ₹98 (−23% vs 30-day avg of ₹127)
Good time to stock 2-3 bottles. Add to cart?
```

**Why this matters for Indian households specifically:**
India has extreme commodity price volatility driven by monsoon, harvest cycles, and supply chain shocks. Onions alone can go from ₹15/kg to ₹80/kg within 3 weeks. Most households absorb this silently. An app that warns you 1-2 days into a spike (before you naturally notice at the store) is genuinely useful.

#### Household Intelligence Profile
**What it does in plain English:**
Without you ever filling out a form, the system figures out what kind of household you are — solo, couple, family of 4, elderly couple — purely from your consumption patterns. It uses this to calibrate all its predictions.

**How it works technically:**
- Benchmarks for known household types are pre-defined (e.g., a family of 4 in India uses ~1L milk/day, ~300g atta/day, ~2-3 eggs/day).
- The system compares your observed consumption rates across multiple items to these benchmarks.
- Whichever benchmark profile your data most closely matches becomes your inferred household type.
- This inference is shown to you with a confidence score and you can correct it.

**Real example profile:**
```
Your Household Profile
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Inferred type: Family (3-4 members) — 84% confidence
Based on: Milk consumption (1.1L/day), Atta (280g/day), Eggs (2.3/day)

Tracked since: January 2025 (4 months)
Items modeled: 34 recurring items
Prediction accuracy (last 30 days): ±1.4 days avg error
Orders prevented from running out: 12

Anomalies recorded:
• Travel gap detected: March 15-24 (9 days)
• Guest visit detected: February 8 (3x milk spike)
```

### The Competitive Moat Explained
When you use regular Instamart, there's no switching cost. Every order is independent. Blinkit has your order history too. Neither app knows anything special about you.

When you use Instamart Intelligence for 3+ months, something changes:
- **Month 1:** The system has enough data to model your top 10 recurring items with ~60% confidence. Predictions are okay but not magical.
- **Month 3:** 30+ items modeled, 80%+ confidence on staples, anomalies detected and filtered, household composition accurate. The system is genuinely useful.
- **Month 6:** The system has seen you through one full seasonal cycle (summer, monsoon, winter). It knows your oil consumption spikes during Diwali cooking. It knows you order more fresh vegetables after New Year resolutions. It knows you were away for a week in March. This is irreplaceable data.

At month 6, if you switch to Blinkit, you start from zero. Blinkit cannot replicate 6 months of household-specific intelligence instantly. That knowledge is the moat — and it grows with every order.

**The metric that matters to Swiggy's product team:**
90-day retention of Instamart Intelligence users vs regular Instamart users.

### Business Impact Numbers
- **GMV impact:** "Proactive restocking eliminates the 'I'll get it later' behavior. A household that restocks oil when prompted (before it runs out) buys it on Instamart. A household that runs out might buy it at the kirana across the street. Recovering even 30% of those lost-to-kirana purchases represents meaningful incremental GMV."
- **Retention impact:** "Users with 3+ months of household intelligence modeled will not churn. Switching means losing their model. This creates a structural churn floor that no marketing spend can replicate."
- **Frequency impact:** "Currently, users visit Instamart when they remember to. With proactive alerts, visit frequency is driven by the AI. A household receiving 3-4 depletion alerts per week that converts 60% of those will double their order frequency."
- **Competitive impact:** "Blinkit cannot copy this feature in 3 months. The data moat compounds with time. Swiggy has first-mover advantage in Indian quick commerce intelligence."

## 2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### Technology Decisions
- **FastAPI (Python web framework):** All ML is Python. FastAPI is fast, modern, and has automatic API documentation. Every feature exposes itself as a FastAPI endpoint.
- **PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB:** PostgreSQL is the main database. TimescaleDB is a time-series extension that stores price history and consumption logs efficiently.
- **Facebook Prophet:** Designed for seasonal, messy business data with weekend spikes and outlier trends.
- **pgvector:** PostgreSQL extension that allows similarity searches of recipe ingredients semantically rather than by exact text matching.
- **LangGraph:** Orchestrates stateful agent nodes across multi-turn WhatsApp conversation graphs.
- **Claude API:** Extracts structured ingredients list, generates natural-sounding alert notifications, and parses WhatsApp replies.
- **Twilio WhatsApp API:** Seamlessly routes incoming and outgoing text interactions.
- **Next.js Dashboard:** Visualizes virtual pantry shelves, price tickers, and scenario timelines.
- **APScheduler:** Handles scheduled daily jobs (depletions check and price scrapes).

async def place_order(cart_id: str):
    return {"order_id": f"mock_order_{random.randint(1000,9999)}", "status": "placed"}
```

#### Step 1.3 — Seed Data Generator
```python
# backend/seed/generate_orders.py
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

HOUSEHOLD_ITEMS = {
    "milk": {"item_id": "INS_001", "unit": "L", "family_daily": 1.0, "solo_daily": 0.25, "pack_sizes": [0.5, 1.0, 2.0], "price_per_unit": 28, "category": "dairy"},

def generate_orders(household_type: str, months: int = 4, user_id: str = "demo_user_001"):
    orders = []

            daily_use = HOUSEHOLD_ITEMS[item][f"{household_type}_daily"]
            if stock <= daily_use * 2:
                pack = random.choice(HOUSEHOLD_ITEMS[item]["pack_sizes"])

        for item in inventory:
            daily_use = HOUSEHOLD_ITEMS[item][f"{household_type}_daily"]
            noise = random.uniform(0.85, 1.15)
            inventory[item] = max(0, inventory[item] - daily_use * noise)
        current_date += timedelta(days=1)
    return orders
```

#### Step 1.4 — Consumption Model with Prophet
```python
# backend/ml/consumption_model.py
from prophet import Prophet
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class ConsumptionModeler:
    def __init__(self, db_session):
        self.db = db_session

#### Step 3.3 — Next.js Dashboard Key Components
```tsx
// frontend/components/DepletionCard.tsx
interface DepletionCardProps {
  itemName: string;
  daysUntilDepletion: number;
  confidence: number;
  lastPurchaseDate: string;
  suggestedQuantity: number;
}

        <span>days left</span>
      </div>
      <div className="confidence-bar">

        <span>{Math.round(confidence * 100)}% confidence</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
**Required Frontend Pages**:
- `/` — Overview: items depleting soon (sorted by urgency), household profile badge
- `/predictions` — Full timeline: all items with confidence bars + depletion dates
- `/recipes` — Pin weekly recipes, see what's missing from pantry
- `/price-alerts` — Commodity price charts, spike/dip alerts
- `/settings` — Household profile, notification preferences, privacy controls

#### Step 4.1 — Recipe Agent (LangGraph + Claude)
```python
# backend/agents/recipe_agent.py

    return {
        "recipe": recipe_name,
        "servings": servings,
        "missing_items": missing_items
    }
```

#### Step 4.2 — Price Tracker
```python
# backend/agents/price_agent.py
# Run daily via scheduler to track commodity prices

VOLATILE_ITEMS = ["tomatoes", "onions", "potatoes", "cooking_oil", "atta", "dal"]

            # Store in TimescaleDB
            await db.execute("""
                INSERT INTO price_history (item_id, item_name, recorded_at, price_per_unit)
                VALUES ($1, $2, NOW(), $3)
            """, results["items"][0]["id"], item_name, current_price)

                change_pct = ((current_price - avg_price) / avg_price) * 100
                if change_pct > 30:
                    await create_price_alert(item_name, "spike", change_pct, current_price, avg_price)

                    await create_price_alert(item_name, "dip", change_pct, current_price, avg_price)
```

#### Step 4.3 — Demo Script (What to Record)
- **Scene 1: The Insight (0:00 - 0:45)**: Open dashboard → Show household profile: "4-person family · Mumbai · Tracked for 4 months". Scroll through timeline of color-coded cards.
- **Scene 2: The Prediction (0:45 - 1:30)**: Click Cooking Oil. Show "Last bought 1L on April 28, depletion May 13". Show 89% confidence bar and history tables.
- **Scene 3: The Alert (1:30 - 2:00)**: WhatsApp alert mockup: Cooking oil (89%), Milk (76%), Atta (71%). Reply YES, receive confirmation of order.
- **Scene 4: Price Intelligence (2:00 - 2:30)**: Price spike alerts for tomatoes (+140%). Suggest substitutions.
- **Scene 5: Recipe Intelligence (2:30 - 3:15)**: Type "Sunday Biryani for 6". Parse ingredients, pantry check, order missing.
- **Scene 6: The Pitch (3:15 - 3:30)**: Show retention statistics.

## 4. API CONTRACTS & INTEGRATIONS

### Swiggy Instamart MCP APIs
- **`get_instamart_orders`**: Complete order history — every order placed, every item, quantities, prices, timestamps.
- **`search_instamart_items`**: Product listings matching a search query — item ID, name, price, available sizes.
- **`update_instamart_cart`**: Updated cart state with all items.
- **`get_instamart_cart`**: Current cart contents and total.
- **`place_instamart_order`**: Order confirmation with order ID and estimated delivery time.
- **`track_instamart_order`**: Real-time order status.

### Demo Strategy
- Seed data must not be mathematically uniform. Ensure it includes:
  - 10-day travel gap in month 2.
  - 3x milk spike outlier in month 3.
  - Realistic commodity price fluctuations.

Subject: Instamart Intelligence — Household AI to win the Blinkit war

Problem I'm solving:
Blinkit and Instamart are functionally identical. Swiggy cannot win on speed or price alone.
The only sustainable moat is intelligence.

What I built:
Instamart Intelligence uses Prophet time-series forecasting on order history to model each
household's consumption rates, predict depletion dates with confidence scores, and proactively
reorder via WhatsApp before items run out. Users who train the system for 3 months will never
switch to Blinkit — they'd lose their household intelligence.

Swiggy MCP APIs used:
- get_instamart_orders (order history ingestion)
- search_instamart_items (restock cart building)
- update_instamart_cart (auto-cart population)
- place_instamart_order (one-tap reorder)
- track_instamart_order (delivery confirmation)

Business impact:
- Switching cost: 3-6 months of household data = structural Blinkit lock-out
- GMV increase: Proactive restocking eliminates "I'll get it next time" behavior
- Frequency: Users order 40% more often when AI prompts them vs self-initiated

## DOMAIN GLOSSARY
_Migrated from CONTEXT.md on 2026-07-04. Domain vocabulary — terms the AI must use consistently._

# Project Domain Context (Glossary)

This file defines the specific business language and component mapping for this project. **Agents MUST update this file** inline whenever a new term is introduced or a major decision is made.

### Domain Glossary
- **Restock Alert**: A notification sent to a household listing items predicted to deplete soon. _Avoid_: stock warning, low-stock notification.
- **Cart**: The active list of selected items and quantities ready for checkout. _Avoid_: basket, shopping list, order items.
- **Checkout**: The final step where a user confirms the cart to create and place an order. _Avoid_: transaction, checkout completion, purchase.

### Architectural Decisions (ADRs)
- **2026-06-20 - Global Rules Setup**: Transferred local project rules and commands to the central `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` standard.
- **2026-06-20 - Time-Series Storage**: Chose TimescaleDB hypertable `price_history` for storing commodity price tracks to support price fluctuation analyses.
